# Sushi Go Round MiniClips Python Bot
A python script for playing MiniClips Sushi-Go-Round Game.
- Note: currently using hardcoded coordinate values for buttons to play game and script only runs on Windows. Future improvements should include PYAUTOGUI Module and use  pyautogui.locateOnScreen() method to dynamically generate game button coordinates.
